# An Introduction and Experiment of Sorts

Hello. This is the start of my website. I decided to start this blog primarily because of COMP2511, which made me fall in love with Markdown and the simplicity of formatting it offers and [Featherbear's blog](https://featherbear.cc/) - they both really inspired me to get started on writing stuff on my own, especially cause I come across a lot of cool Computer Science related stuff in my studies nowadays, and it'll be a cool way to consolidate my knowledge. 

To christen my blog and get it ready for it's first voyage on the deep-web, I guess I will talk about the stuff I am currently into, and what stuff you might see come up in the future. 

## Competitive Programming 

This is something I am very much a newbie at, (it might actually be an insult to competitive programmers to call myself one :P), but is something I am very interested in. Pushing code to it's absolute limits in order to maximise a piece of code's efficency, and using obscure proofs and data structures made by a man living in a cave is very **very** cool IMO. I am currently a LeetCode man - I try to pump out a few LeetCode questions every now and then - primarily in preparation for my internship application season, which is creeping up on me very quickly, but also for the sake of keeping my brain sharp and honing my problem solving skills. It's my goal to have a strong grasp on Algorithmic Design before I enroll in my University's Advanced Algorithms course, which I have decided to emphasis by embarking on a journey to read both the Algorithm Design Manual and the CTCI book everyone borderline shoves down your throat. 

## Software Design and Development 

As I previously said, I am currently undertaking COMP2511. I find this to be an extremely fun subject - which is surprising because most of my friends feel the stark opposite. I am very much enjoying the concept of employing design strategies and patterns to create software which is both extensible and readable, allowing for modular pieces of code that form something truly amazing when looking at the overall picture. In this realm - I do want to explore more the concept of test-driven development, and how I can further optimise my development skills by writing long series of tests before I embarking on coding / fleshing out functionality in order to optimise my development time. This brings me to a shocking revelation I had that I might get a slight amount of hate for: 

### OOP is not *that* bad

It's fine. Like honestly speaking - I don't get the hate (and I know the hate is just a small minority being loud). Its a great way to organise and design your code. It makes it very easy to create extensible code and I honestly could not fathom how to program any larger project in a procedural style. I don't know specifically why, but I have loved the concept of abstraction ever since I discovered it - the idea of being able to ignore everything but the exact thing I am working on is very very appealing to me, and it feels like this concept is very well utilised in the concept of OOP. When your code is written nicely, it feels amazing. 



## Books 

I like to read. A lot. Here is a taste into some of the books I have enjoyed (a tick means I am up to date)
